# Quinn Darling

## A short introduction
Hi there, I'm Quinn! I'm thirty, nonbinary, and bad at talking about myself. Um.

Super good text right here, I tell you what. Boy howdy. Yessir, some real good stuff. Real good.

~~SixEight~~**NINE** commits in and I'm running out of things to say here. I'm doing my best, Phill. I promise I am.

This will be my last commit.

...Just kidding, I need one more to test out my SSH key.

~~It didn't workTestingI hope I didn't break it real bad this time~~Everything is perfect?
